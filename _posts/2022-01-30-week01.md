# Week 1: An Introduction to Open Source

This week was spent learning the basics about Open Source as a concept and movement and understanding the benefits and difficulties that come with it.

## Background on Open Source
Open Source is a movement that started in the 70s/80s and has since been criticized for fears of communist influences as well as get adopted by many large tech companies.

Open Source as a business model is hard to understand as the basic concepts of Open Source is that the code, which would ordinarily be proprietary, is given away freely not only for use but also for modification and reproduction depending on the license.

When it comes to Open Source the licensing is king as the licensing is what differentiates regular proprietary code protected by copyright laws from Open Source code. Open Source projects have the advantage that because they are open to viewing of the source code and modification, they can capitalize on the expertise of anyone around the world who may want to contribute to the project. On the other side of the spectrum, you run the risk of competitors using your code. The benefit of closed, copyrighted code is that there is much less possibility that the code will be used by any competitor against the owner of the original code. This dichotomy is balanced by the fact that the likelihood that a competitor steals a whole code base is low and the benefits to society and human development as a whole from sharing resources and technology outweigh the personal/proprietary concerns.

I joined the Open Source class because Open Source is an incredibly interesting and dynamic topic that I know very little of. Open Source feels like a much more realistic depiction of one aspect of coding which students are not typically exposed to in other courses. Not only will it force me to step outside of my comfort zone and work with other more advanced programmers, but it will also expose me to much more realistic code bases as instead of simple school projects with few files, I will be contributing to comparatively giant code bases that better reflect the reality of software development.
This week I started compiling possible Open Source projects and in the weeks to come I will dig deeper into some of these projects to see where I would be able to contribute. My main concern is that I will simply not have enough technical knowledge to be able to contribute to a project. The other main concern with trying to contribute to an Open Source project is that the community may be toxic, however, I'm not too worried about this as if I go in with the expectation that some members of the community will be toxic and others will not I won't be as negatively affected by those more unsavory. I also have experience dealing with toxic people on the internet so their presence in the Open Source community does not come as much of a surprise.

After some research and thinking about Open Source projects that I may not have realized are Open Source below are my top picks:

### Wikipedia:
Wikipedia is not only an open source project in terms of its code, but also from the standpoint of the posts which comprise the essential functions of the digital encyclopedia.

### Reddit:
Reddit is partially open source on the code side however, like Wikipedia, the contents which comprise the essential features, subreddits and posts, are created by the community making it an open product.

### GIMP
GIMP is a photo editing tool which is open source and distributed as a free alternative to other expensive photo editing software. I briefly used GIMP for minor photo editing when my access to Photoshop was revoked and I was very appreciative that open tools like GIMP exist.

### Blender
Blender is a graphics and animation tool that supports many video editing tools such as simluations, renderings, motion capture and more. I have personally used Blender very little but I watch many videos of visual effects artists who use Blender on a daily basis to create fun and creative projects to share on Youtube: [Corridor Crew](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSpFnDQr88xCZ80N-X7t0nQ).
